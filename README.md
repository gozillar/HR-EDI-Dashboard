# HR Recruitment Analytics Dashboard – EDI (Equity, Diversity &amp; Inclusion)

This Power BI dashboard provides an end-to-end view of applicant diversity across the recruitment lifecycle, enabling HR and school leadership to monitor representation, identify drop-off points, and support evidence-based EDI reporting. It brings together applicant pipeline data across recruitment stages (e.g., shortlisting, interviews, offers, contract issued, withdrawals, rejections) and visualizes outcomes by ethnic group and academic year for quick diagnosis and trend monitoring. 

## Data Source & Scope
- Source: HR Recruitment Data Extract (2025)
- Coverage:

3,000+ recruitment records

Two academic years (2023–2024 and 2024–2025)

Data collected under a new management structure

- Granularity: Individual applicant records and recruitment stage outcomes

- Dimensions:

Academic Year

Job Applied For

Recruitment Stage

Ethnic Group

- Use Case: Recruitment pipeline analysis, EDI monitoring, leadership reporting

This dataset provides a robust, post-transition baseline for monitoring recruitment outcomes and diversity trends following organisational change, enabling leadership to track progress and identify early signals requiring intervention.

## Key Questions the Dashboard Answers
- How diverse is the applicant pool overall and by academic year? 
- Where do candidates from different ethnic groups progress or drop off within recruitment stages? (Grouped & ungrouped stage views) 
- Are there observable shifts in ethnic representation year-on-year (e.g., 2023–2024 vs 2024–2025)? 
- What is the relationship between applications, roles, and average applications per role for the selected period? 


## What’s Included
- KPI summary tiles (e.g., total applications, jobs, average applications per role) and slicers (Academic Year, Job Applied For) for fast segmentation. 
- Year-on-year percentage distribution of applicants by ethnic group for diversity trend tracking. 
- A stage-by-stage recruitment pipeline breakdown showing applicant counts by ethnic group across key stages, with both grouped/sorted and ungrouped/unsorted views to support detailed operational analysis. 
- Clear sourcing and repeatable reporting structure (“Source: HR EDI Data 2025”) suitable for compliance and governance contexts. 


## Suggested Usage
- Monthly/termly HR review: monitor representation shifts and pipeline conversion.
- EDI reporting: support narrative with quantified, filterable evidence.
- Process improvement: locate stage-specific disparities and prioritize interventions.


## Impact Summary
- Enabled EDI transparency across the full recruitment funnel by consolidating applicant counts and outcomes across multiple recruitment stages into a single interactive view, making it easier to spot where representation changes through the pipeline. 
- Improved decision readiness for HR and leadership through year-on-year ethnicity distribution reporting (e.g., comparative views for 2023–2024 vs 2024–2025), supporting evidence-based recruitment planning and accountability. 
- Accelerated root-cause analysis of recruitment outcomes using both grouped and ungrouped stage visualizations—allowing stakeholders to drill from high-level bottlenecks (e.g., rejections/withdrawals) into more granular workflow steps (e.g., specific interview stages, offer/contract milestones). 
- Strengthened governance and consistency by standardizing how diversity and recruitment pipeline data is presented (repeatable slicers, clear stage taxonomy, and explicit source attribution), reducing reliance on manual reporting and ad-hoc spreadsheets.
