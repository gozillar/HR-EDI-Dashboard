# HR Recruitment Analytics Dashboard – EDI (Equity, Diversity & Inclusion)

## Project Overview

This Power BI project presents an **HR Recruitment Analytics Dashboard** designed to analyse **equity, diversity, and applicant progression** across the recruitment lifecycle. The dashboard enables HR teams and senior leadership to assess representation, identify potential disparities across recruitment stages, and support **evidence-based decision-making** under a new management structure.

The solution visualises recruitment outcomes across key stages—including application, shortlisting, interviews, offers, contract issuance, withdrawals, and rejections—and enables comparisons by **ethnic group** and **academic year**.
